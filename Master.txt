Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. 
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. 
Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, 
logical code for small and large-scale projects.The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault.
